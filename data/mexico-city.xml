    										<scene>Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes fall tragically in love in Baz Luhrmann's contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Verona, Italy, which is transplanted to a futuristic, sex- and violence-riddled Verona Beach, Fla. Verona Beach has no real-life counterpart, being a figment of imagination created by a combination of settings in and around Mexico City and Veracruz.</scene>
