    										<scene>As you pull into the town of Holderness, the marina looks much the same as when they filmed Katharine HepburnÂ’s scene to get the boat to rescue Norman and Billy on their ill-fated fishing trip. If you take a tour boat ride on Squam Lake, you will see the cottage where the movie was filmed along with Purgatory Cove.</scene>
