    										<scene>Several scenes in and around the area. The opening credit first bridge was 4 miles south of Fairfax crossing the Arkansas River-this was the chopper flyover shot. 1mile west was the "divorce signing" at the beginning of the picture. The CGI generated "flying farm equipment" scene was just south of the Arkansas River in Ralston, OK (where our middle school is). Other shots were close to the area as well, some at Kaw Lake, and one at Belford Bridge west of town.</scene>
